This web application helps senior citizens living in retirement homes connect with their communities.
It allows them to vote on the types of events they would like to see as well as RSVP to attend specific ones.

The app was designed to be used even by those unfamiliar or uncomfortable with current technology. A streamlined onboarding process along
with an efficient, easy to use interface make it attractive to users of varying skill levels.

The app uses current location to automatically select the community a user belongs to and helps them create an account using just their name 
and a 4 digit PIN. An authorized organizer can put up events for the residents to vote on, and choose to attend.
